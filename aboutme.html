        <p>I currently live in Seoul, Korea, but went to a boarding school in Connecticut. I went to college in New York City, but dropped out before my final semester to pursue my diverse interests. I was an economics major, but was unsatisfied with my prospects and was not immersed in the studies. I found interest in the subject waning as the courses grew more theoretical. I found interest in marketing and public relations while interning at a PR and advertising company. One day I was walking back from class in the hallways of the economics building when I was struck by a thought: what if I could pursue my own career instead of stressing out over a subject I was not fully committed to? I returned home without a degree, to the wonderment of my parents, who were also disappointed to say the least. At first my endeavors failed, mostly because I did not know how to begin. I was new to the world of running the world of business, much less marketing and sales. To begin with, what product would I be selling? 
        After a while, I started to realize that first I needed a solid background in marketing in order to get my head in that space. I decided to market myself. Then after, I would use the knowledge I gained during the learning process to design and sell a product.<br></p>

        <p>The core of the portfolio itself and my work is going to be marketing analytics and marketing strategy, but at the start the projects will be SEO and content marketing strategies.  The reason is because I've always had an interest in content marketing and most importantly, writing. I've included in the portfolio writing samples, such as essays and short stories for fun and then finally writing samples for internships. <b>There's nothing in the world you can't do if you try.</b></p>
