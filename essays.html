<p>It is shown in the first paragraph of Tobias Wolff’s novel Old School the protagonist is a boy who is very involved with his school. He analyzes each visiting writer as if he were the school’s eyes: “We recognized Kennedy; we could still see in him the boy who would have been a favorite here, roguish and literate...” (3) Although Wolff’s main character is a typical student bounded by classes, rules, and morals, he is characterized as ambitious and “upward-striving.” (23)  Wolff reveals that the protagonist is a flawed and complicated individual, keen to succeed but contradicting the very foundations of the school, perhaps hinting that his lack of maturity will be his downfall later in the novel.</p>
  <p>The protagonist largely draws on his personal experiences and interactions with the other students to strategize winning a literary competition in which the winning student meets the famous writer or poet and has his submission printed in the school publication. Here Wolff describes his first competitor George Kellogg as “(earning) his position, tirelessly soliciting manuscripts from other boys, burning the midnight oil to put the latest number to bed before deadline.” (9) However, Wolff admits that he “did none of those things” (9) and spent his time elsewhere. Wolff’s description of the protagonist’s disappointment at getting the editorship shows a lack of effort. </p><p>He admits that “I wasn’t after an A in Citizenship.” (9) Wolff’s character is then far from the perfect writer or student, and rather than trying too hard, passively observes his competition and strategizes accordingly. Moreover he criticizes Kellogg's work in detail and  he adds that “he seemed more professor than writer.” (10) Wolff examines the lead’s tendency to overthink about his competition and also his conflicting interests: he wants desperately to succeed but almost always takes a back seat. However, there is little mention of the his analysis of his own writing habits. His passive stance reveals that he compares himself to others prematurely.</p>
<p>Also, Wolff avoids any blunt representation of the protagonist’s inferior class and instead implies it through the character of Gershon. Gershon, a handyman, takes offense at his singing of a Nazi marching song, which he unknowingly whistles. He is horrified and panicked at his own behavior. He writes: “...we were actors in a play, and that outside the theater was a world we would have to reckon with when the curtain closed and the doors were flung open.” (15) This reality that the protagonist speaks of is the often violent and cruel world. Yet the protagonist views this reality with defensiveness: “Why would I want to talk my way into his unlucky tribe. All of this came over me as a  gathering sense of suffocation.” (23) Rather than embrace his heritage the protagonist chooses to maintain a certain sense of loyalty to the school by separating himself from the handyman, thereby establishing his superiority within his own class. </p><p>He describes that the school treated Jewish students differently and had a “guardian spirit...risen from the fields and walkways and weathered stone to breathe that apartness upon them.” (24) Wolff imparts a sense of fear that permeates the protagonist’s being when he recalls his mother’s words that his father is Jewish: “It became a shadow on my faith in the school.” (24) Therefore Wolff’s character is still uncertain about his heritage and how he should feel about his association with people like Gershon. </p>
<p>Perhaps Wolff’s intention was to create a flawed but likeable character. The protagonist is without a doubt likeable. He is observant and shrewd, despite his misgivings. His attitude although in a school mostly full of the upper class is forward-thinking and ambitious, and he is not lazy or dejected. Wolff creates an individual rich in complexity by using flawed elements to capture the attention of the reader using the intrigue and adventures of a 1960s elite preparatory boarding school. </p>
