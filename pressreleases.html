<p>City, State: Luxuryhomes.com, the leading home design company in North America today announced it would be expanding its operations to Asia. The company, which prides itself on modeling and producing striking and unique designs for residential and commercial projects, will tie up with Taozi Construction to expand its business.</p>

<p>“We are absolutely thrilled to partner with Taozi Construction and show the world that our designs are truly the best, not only in the States but across the world,” says owner and CEO of Luxury Homes, Larry Ward. “Their contribution in every project will be significant, and it’s an honor to be able to design alongside their team.”</p>

<p>Luxuryhomes.com has been designing state-of-the art facilities and private homes for North American clientele since 2009.
