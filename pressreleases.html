        <h1>Wed April 18</h1>
        <p>Ever got stuck in the mud and can't get out? That's how I felt trying to put the pieces of my life together. I didn't have a breakdown or anything like that but I was in a limbo: I did not know where I was going, or where to start. I only knew one thing: that I had to make a drastic change in my life or I would be gobbled up by the rest of the world. My safe haven was writing, and it has been for a long time. But these past two years have brought nothing but distractions from my ultimate goal.</p>
        <p>Today I would start writing again, and I would most importantly continue learning about marketing. It would help me become more grounded and authentic. It would keep me on my toes.</p>
        <p>Now enough about me and on to the good stuff. I'm learning about Google Analytics, whhich requires putting a snippet of code into all my html files. I'm currently having difficulty seeing the number of active users on site (=1) right now in the real-time overview. </p>
        <p><br>Oh it looks like I had to go to master view instead of test view and it's all good now. Right now, there is 1 active user on my site (that's me!) I am also on the <a href = "https://analytics.google.com/analytics/academy/"><b>Google Analytics Academy</b></a> website. Today I'm learning about the Google Analytics layout. Should be interesting, since right now my knowledge of Google Analytics is next to zero. This free course is not only helpful but should provide you with the most important foundations in using analytics for your marketing. </p>
