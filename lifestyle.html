          <p>I went to the hospital today. I was armed with a bag and my Macbook and my coffee tumbler. Everyone should have a coffee tumbler for when they go somewhere earlier in the morning, for something simple like a hospital trip, for example. You can replace the coffee with hot tea. </p>

          <h2>Monday Jan 22</h2>
          <p>Anybody drink coffee? It's cold out and there's nothing that says Monday morning like a nice cup of coffee. Even if it takes the extra time, make the coffee yourself and spend the extra hour awake before going to work sipping on a hot drink.</p>
