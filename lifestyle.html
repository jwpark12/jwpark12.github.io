          <p>Two important shoes that are must-haves are black with red soles and gold with red soles. They are really versatile, for when you go to parties. The black ones look great with jeans as well. The red soles give you a sexy look. So anyhow those arrived today, not a big

          <p>I went to the hospital today. I was armed with a bag and my Macbook and my coffee tumbler. Everyone should have a coffee tumbler for when they go somewhere earlier in the morning, for something simple like a hospital trip, for example. You can replace the coffee with hot tea. I love how simple things can make your day much better, or more bearable. I usually detest hospital visits, but having coffee with me made me happier. Another item you must not miss is a nice bag to carry your Macbook in. I prefer black bags because they go with anything and draw less attention. I'm into monotone colors. In fact I recently discovered a online shoe store called Monobabie. Their shoes are excellent and within a reasonable price range. Here's their website: <a href="http://en.monobabie.com/">Monobabie.</a>  Any chance I get I try to wear monotone colors. Anyhow this bag from Zara fits my laptop perfectly and is very sturdy. It's used to carrying a lot of heavy items and yet still persists and is reliable. </p>

          <p>Anybody drink coffee? It's cold out and there's nothing that says Monday morning like a nice cup of coffee. Even if it takes the extra time, make the coffee yourself and spend the extra hour awake before going to work sipping on a hot drink.</p>
